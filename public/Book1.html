            "The Kingdom of God Is Within You" is a powerful essay by Leo Tolstoy, rejecting militarism and advocating for a society founded on principles of peace, freedom, and love derived from Jesus's teachings. Tolstoy, drawing from his own experiences in the Crimean War, criticizes the Christian Church's hypocrisy in supporting violence while professing Christ's message. He explores the history of non-resistance to evil, acknowledging precedents set by groups like the Quakers. Ultimately, the essay serves as a call to reevaluate societal values and embrace a more compassionate and nonviolent approach to conflict resolution.

            "The Three Hermits" is a short story by Leo Tolstoy that follows a bishop's encounter with three humble hermits living on a remote island. Despite their lack of education and understanding of formal religious practices, the hermits possess a deep, genuine faith in God. The bishop, initially intrigued by their simplicity, attempts to teach them the correct way to pray. However, he soon realizes that their earnest devotion transcends mere words and rituals. As the story unfolds, the bishop witnesses a miraculous display of their faith when the hermits walk on water to seek his guidance once more. In this poignant tale, Tolstoy explores themes of humility, spirituality, and the true essence of faith, emphasizing that genuine devotion to God lies in the heart rather than in formalities or intellectual knowledge.
